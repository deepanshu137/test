    <h1>Computer Programing</h1>
        <p>Computer programming is the process of designing and building an executable computer program to accomplish a specific computing result. Programming involves tasks such as: analysis, generating algorithms, profiling algorithms' accuracy and resource consumption, and the implementation of algorithms in a chosen programming language (commonly referred to as coding). The source code of a program is written in one or more languages that are intelligible to programmers, rather than machine code, which is directly executed by the central processing unit. The purpose of programming is to find a sequence of instructions that will automate the performance of a task (which can be as complex as an operating system) on a computer, often for solving a given problem. The process of programming thus often requires expertise in several different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms, and formal logic.

            Tasks accompanying and related to programming include: testing, debugging, source code maintenance, implementation of build systems, and management of derived artifacts, such as the machine code of computer programs. These might be considered part of the programming process, but often the term software development is used for this larger process with the term programming, implementation, or coding reserved for the actual writing of code. Software engineering combines engineering techniques with software development practices. Reverse engineering is the opposite process. A hacker is any skilled computer expert that uses their technical knowledge to overcome a problem, but it can also mean a security hacker in common language.</p>

    <h1>What Computer Programer Do?</h1>
        <p>Computer programmers write and test code that allows computer applications and software programs to function properly. They turn the program designs created by software developers and engineers into instructions that a computer can follow. In addition, programmers test newly created applications and programs to ensure that they produce the expected results. If they do not work correctly, computer programmers check the code for mistakes and fix them.</p>
        <h1>Duties of Computer Programmers</h1>
    </div>
        <div class="level3">
        <p>*Write programs in a variety of computer languages, such as <strong>C++</strong> and<strong> Java</strong><br>
*Update and expand existing programs<br>
*Test programs for errors and fix the faulty lines of computer code<br>
*Create and test code in an integrated development environment (IDE)<br>
*Use code libraries, which are collections of independent lines of code, to simplify the writing<br> </p>
    </div>
            <div class="level4">
            <p>Programmers work closely with software developers, and in some businesses their duties overlap. When such overlap occurs, programmers can do work that is typical of developers, such as designing programs. Program design entails planning the software initially, creating models and flowcharts detailing how the code is to be written, writing and debugging code, and designing an application or systems interface.<br>

A program's purpose determines the complexity of its computer code. For example, a weather application for a mobile device will require less programming than a social-networking application. Simpler programs can be written in less time. Complex programs, such as computer operating systems, can take a year or more to complete.<br>

Software-as-a-service (SaaS), which consists of applications provided through the Internet, is a growing field. Although programmers typically need to rewrite their programs to work on different system platforms, such as Windows or OS X, applications created with SaaS work on all platforms. Accordingly, programmers writing SaaS applications may not have to rewrite as much code as other programmers do and can instead spend more time writing new programs.<br></p>

    <p> Employment opportunities in the tech industry are booming, especially in programming. In fact, programming jobs are growing 12 percent faster than the average for all occupations, according to recent findings by job market research firm BurningGlass.<br>

Programmers can find job opportunities in a variety of industries, including the financial sector, government, healthcare and marketing/advertising. Programming skills can also be applied in the emerging field of data security.<br>

With remote and flexible work options, high job security and the opportunity to blend creativity with high-demand technical skills, programming-related careers are some of the highest-rated technology jobs today.<br></p>

        <strong><p>Here is a look at some of the most popular programming-related careers:</p></strong>
    <p>
        <strong>Software Developer</strong><br>
        <img src="software.jpg" align="left" width="600px" height="500px;">
Software developers design the technologies and systems that we rely on many times per day for business, entertainment or daily living. Consider your online shopping experiences, a typical day at your job, or your favorite apps. Software developers play a large role in shaping all of those online experiences.

Successful software developers are both highly creative and technically skilled. They collaborate with clients to design software that best meets their needs, but they also work with computer programmers who write the code for new applications. With the advent of mobile technology, there’s even greater opportunity for software developers to help businesses adapt their operations for a mobile-first, tech-savvy generation of customers.

Employment for software developers is expected to grow by 24 percent by 2026. Due to the growth of mobile technology, job opportunities for applications software developers are expected to grow by 31 percent during the same period.</p>
</div>
    <div class="level8"><p>
    <strong>Web Developer</strong><br>
        <img src="web.jpg" width="650px" align="right" height="400px">
Not only do web developers write the code for websites, they also design the look of the site so that is both visually appealing and user-friendly. Web developers must have extensive knowledge of a variety of programming languages, such as HTML, JavaScript and SQL. Employers might require a bachelor’s degree in computer science or programming for back-end or more specialized web development positions.

According to the BLS, web development jobs are projected to grow by as much as 15% by 2026, adding another 24,400 new jobs. Much of this growth will be in the e-commerce industry, as more retailers look to expand or redesign their online offerings.
        </p>
        <div class="level9">
            <strong>Systems Analyst</strong><br>
            <img src="system.jpg"  width="600px" align="left">
            Computer systems analysts evaluate an organization’s IT systems and help them decide which upgrades are needed to improve efficiencies. Some analysts might work within an organization to address IT needs, or for an IT consulting firm. As organizations continue to implement new data management systems, employment for systems analysts is expected to increase. The BLS predicts steady employment growth of 9 percent through 2026.
        </div>
        <div class="level10">
            <strong>Database Developer</strong><br>
Database developers are responsible for building and creating data management systems for organizations. Database developers must be skilled in basic computer programming languages and also be proficient in writing database-specific code like Structured Query Language (SQL).

Database developers serve as a liaison between the database administrators, who maintain the system, and the actual users of the database. Therefore, they must know how to communicate effectively with different groups of people, some of which have the technical knowledge and others merely user-based knowledge.
